### About The Designs : 

This repository is not usefull for anyone. Whatever the plastic items that my daughter and I broke at home, 
I designed/re-designed using FreeCad, then 3D printed and repaired them in the same dimensions. Then, I lost 
these designs between multiple computer. So that's why I open up this repository.
